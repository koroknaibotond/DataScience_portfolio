# Linear Regression - Supervised Learning

This project demonstrates the application of Linear Regression, a fundamental supervised learning technique, to predict outcomes based on continuous input variables. 
Utilizing Python and C++, this project showcases the implementation of a basic linear regression model using the normal equation and the gradient descendent method.

## ðŸ§ª Usage

To explore the project, open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/linear_regression.ipynb
```

This notebook guides you through the entire workflow, from data loading to model evaluation. For further mathematical explonation please read the pdf file which can be found in the repository.

## ðŸ“Š Results

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errorsâ€”that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.
* **RÂ² Score**: Indicates how well the regression predictions approximate the real data points.

These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions.
