# 📊 Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio!  
This repository is a **showcase of my journey in the domain of Data Science**, featuring projects implemented in **Python** and **C++**.  

Currently, it explores the foundational algorithms in suprervised machine learning such as **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression**.

## 🚀 Projects

- 📈 [Linear Regression](projects/linear-regression/README.md)  
  Implemented Linear Regression in Python (Jupyter Notebook) with an additional compiled C++ version. Includes data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.  

- 🔮 [Logistic Regression](projects/logistic-regression/README.md)  
  Built a Logistic Regression model for binary classification tasks, covering data cleaning, model training, and performance evaluation.
